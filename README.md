# Signalium Debug

This repository provides a reproduction for an issue I encountered using Signalium in a Vite-React-TypeScript-MUI app.

This app can be run in 2 different modes:

- Working - workaround employed to show the intended functioning of the app
- Broken - the sort menu does not open

The mode is set in app-state.ts.
