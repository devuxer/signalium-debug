# Signalium Debug

This repository provides reproductions for a couple issues I have encountered using Signalium in a Vite-React-TypeScript-MUI app.

This app can be run in 3 different modes:

- Everything Works - workarounds employed to show the intended correct functioning of the app
- Sort Menu Bug - the sort menu does not open
- Dashboard Bug - the sort menu does open and functions as intended, but the items in the dashboard don't sort

The mode is set in app-state.ts.
