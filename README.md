# Signalium Debug

This branch provides a reproduction for a different issue where the Dashboard does not re-sort when the sort direction is toggled.

This app can be run in 2 different modes:

- Working - workaround employed to show the intended functioning of the app
- Broken - the items in the dashboard do not re-sort when the sort direction is changed

The mode is set in app-state.ts.
